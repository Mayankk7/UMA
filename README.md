# User Management App

This is a simple user management application built with React. It allows you to add, edit, and delete user records.

## Features

1. **Add New Users**: The application provides a form component where you can add new users. The form includes fields for the user's name, email address, and phone number. It performs validation on the form inputs to ensure they meet the required criteria.

2. **Display User List**: The main page of the application displays a list of users. Each user is represented by a card or a list item, showing their name, email, and phone number.

3. **Edit User Information**: The application allows you to edit user information. By clicking on the "Edit" button on each user card, a modal or a separate page opens where you can update the user's details. The edit form also includes appropriate form validation.

4. **Delete User Records**: The application enables the deletion of user records. Each user card has a "Delete" button that allows you to remove a user from the list.
